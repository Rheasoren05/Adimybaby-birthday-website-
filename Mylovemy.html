    <h1>Happy Birthday Adi ❤️</h1>

  <div class="letter">
Hey, adi baby!  
Happy birthday!!!! My baby, my cute baby. You're 21 now!!! Finally the legal drinking age!!! 🙈🙈 Now you can legally drink without worrying to ever get caught for underage drinking 💀 I love you, my legally adult baby 🙈🙈🙈  
I can't tell you how much I was waiting for your birthday! I was so excited for your birthday 😭😭😭  
Because you deserve the world, love. Everything. All the happiness. All the safety. All the support. And I hope in your 21st year, you get all of that.  
I don’t have anything big or grand for you. But I made this. This little digital space. With memories. Because that's what I cherish the most.  
Adi, in the past few months you've changed my life. You've made me feel what love is supposed to feel like. Not just the butterflies but the love and care.
I know we have our fights. And I know long distance is hard. But i also know i cant be without you. As i always say, i would rather suffer with you than for you.  
We're meant to be together,love. Meant to love.  
I still remember the first time you called me your girlfriend after i fell for you and the first time i called you my boyfriend, i got butterflies, oh god!.  
The way you say "baby" and I melt even when I don't want to.  
You love me in ways I never imagined someone could.  
You care. You protect. You scold. You support. You stay.  
You stayed. Even when I broke down. Even when I cried. Even when I was hard to love.  
And that's what matters.  
Thank you for choosing me everyday.  
For fighting with me, and then holding me after.  
For dreaming with me. Planning with me. Growing with me.  
You're my person, Adi.  
I see a future with you.  
I see us fighting over what to name our second cat.  
I see us decorating our kitchen.  
I see us naming our daughter Sia.  
I see it all.  
And today, I just want to say, I love you.  
So so so much.  
From,  
Your Rheu ❤️
